# ToDo-App-FullStack
Link: https://damians-todos.herokuapp.com/

Basic todo app to learn about Vue.js, deployment, and NoSQL databases, namely Couchbase and MongoDB. Couchbase implementation commented out, but will work if uncommented and run locally. Implemented with Vue.js on the frontend, Node.js/Express on the backend, MongoDB, and Passport.js for authentication.
