Basic todo app to learn about Vue.js, deployment, and NoSQL databases, namely Couchbase and MongoDB. Couchbase implementation commented out, but will work if uncommented and run locally. MongoDB database hosted on MongoDB Atlas. Implemented with Vue.js on the frontend with Node.js/Express on the backend with a MongoDB Atlas database and Passport.js authentication.
